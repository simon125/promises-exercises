/**
 * Create a function that takes in a number and returns a promise
 * that resolves to the square of that number after a 2 second delay
 */

/**
 * Create a function that returns a promise that resolves to the current time after a 1 second delay.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in a number and returns a promise
 * that resolves to the number, but rejects if the number is less than 10.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in a number and returns
 * a promise that resolves to the number multiplied by 2 after a 3 second delay.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that returns a promise that resolves to a random number between 1 and 10 after a 2 second delay
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in a string and returns
 * a promise that resolves to the length of that string after a 1 second delay.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in a boolean value and returns a promise that resolves with the
 * string "True" if the input value is true, or "False" if the input value is false.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in two numbers and returns a promise that resolves with the result of
 * dividing the first number by the second after a 3 second delay.
 * If the second number is 0, the promise should reject with an error message.
 */

/**
 * Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a promise that resolves
 * with the sum of all the numbers in the array after a 1 second delay.
